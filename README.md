## Overview

ArduinoPong brings back the retro charm of Pong with a modern microcontroller twist. Designed as part of a final project for **Course 0512-4494 (Real-Time Lab)** at **Tel Aviv University**, this game runs smoothly on an Arduino Nano, complete with:

1. **Dual Game Modes**:
   * **Two-player mode**: Each player controls a paddle using a slide potentiometer.
   * **Single-player mode**: Play against a built-in AI opponent.

2. **State Machine Game Engine**:
   * Cleanly separated setup, gameplay, and game-over states.
   * OLED screen rendering via I²C using Adafruit GFX & SSD1306 drivers.

3. **Live Feedback**:
   * Sound effects via buzzer.
   * Start screen, scorekeeping, and win screen on OLED.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aimanabed/ArduinoPong.git
cd ArduinoPong
Open pong.ino in the Arduino IDE.
Install dependencies via Library Manager.
Connect your Arduino Nano and select the right COM port and board.
Usage

Wire hardware as described above.
Upload the code (pong.ino) to your Arduino Nano.
Use the slide switch to select:
Left = Two-Player Mode
Right = Single-Player Mode
Move paddles via potentiometers.
Buzzer plays sounds on collisions and scores.
